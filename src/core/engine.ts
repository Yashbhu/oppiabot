/**
 * The Oppiabot Core Engine is the central orchestration layer responsible for
 * coordinating repository automation.
 *
 * A runtime entrypoint (a webhook handler or a scheduled workflow) builds an
 * ExecutionContext and passes it to `execute()`. The engine resolves the
 * registered plugins whose `supportedTriggers` match the context's trigger and
 * runs each of them once, in the order the plugins were registered.
 *
 * The engine does not tell webhook executions and scheduled executions apart.
 * Both arrive as an ExecutionContext and take the same code path; the only
 * difference between them is which entrypoint built the context and what the
 * entrypoint put in `payload`.
 *
 * Responsibilities:
 * - Validate the execution context.
 * - Resolve plugins applicable to the execution trigger.
 * - Run each applicable plugin and isolate its failures.
 * - Aggregate the per-plugin results into a single return value.

   *
   * Failures are isolated per plugin: a plugin that throws does not stop the
   * remaining plugins from running, and does not reject this promise. Its
